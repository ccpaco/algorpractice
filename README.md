# Please be advised :
This was made around the time Github changed default branch names from Master to Main, so please refer to Master branch for most of the code, as I've tried to reset the branches or change the default one to no avail. 

# Overview
Basic HTML and CSS for markup, using JS to output the results of various coding exercises. Viewable at https://ccpaco.github.io/algorpractice/ , hosted by the amazing Github Pages. 

# algorpractice
Algor practice is a simple template for vanilla JS training with my good friend Nathaniel Giron (https://github.com/NathanielGiron). Check out the Master branch for web files. Short for Algorithm practice, nothing to do with a former Vice President.
